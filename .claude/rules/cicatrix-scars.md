### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: WR2 master template requires verified richtext slot count (2026-05-10 → architecturally bypassed 2026-05-13)

_Discovered: 2026-05-10 02:53 WITA · Patched via `chore/wr2-pipeline-hardening-2026-05-10` · **Architecturally bypassed 2026-05-13 via `feat/wr2-canva-pdf-render-2026-05-13`** (ReportLab→Tigris→Canva import, no master template required) · Severity: P0 (defanged)_

**RESOLUTION (2026-05-13):** New rendering pipeline: PDF generated server-side via ReportLab (`wr2_canva_pdf_render.py`, 12 layout families), uploaded to Tigris S3, imported into Canva via `import-design-from-url` MCP → no richtext slots needed.

| Design ID | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `DAHE6lx1lf8` | DECOMMISSIONED 2026-05-08 | Original master, obsolete |
| `DAHJLYRn_3E` | KEPT AS FAILURE EXAMPLE | Only 2 usable pages (PR #565 failed) |
| `DAHJEkWpkzY` | UNUSED IN NEW FLOW | Was the 2026-05-10 "fix" master |

**Production cron disabled 2026-05-13**: kill switch `system_settings.wr2_canva_renderer_enabled='false'` + `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.balizero.wr2.canva-renderer`. Plist preserved on disk for reload after orchestrator refactor. Queue: 0 pending, 20 rendered + 15 rejected.

New `canva_renderer_v2` package (~1000 LOC, 9 modules). T1-T13 commits on `feat/wr2-canva-pdf-render-2026-05-13`, 47/47 unit tests passing. Key modules: migration 170 lease columns, `_telegram.py`, `_schema_adapter.py`, `_pdf_pipeline.py`, `_tigris.py`, `_token_storage.py` (HMAC+flock), `_canva_mcp.py` (mcp SDK 1.27.0), `_pg.py` asyncpg, `_telemetry.py`, orchestrator, entrypoint, bootstrap+watchdogs, 3 launchd plists. Deploy via `docs/runbooks/wr2-orchestrator-pdf-render-runbook.md`.

**TRAUMA:** PR #565 promoted `DAHJLYRn_3E` as new master without verifying its shape. Design only had richtext slots on pages 2-3; renderer emits ops for pages 1+4-11. Phase A live-mapping detected 19/22 ops (86%) would drop → `template_mismatch`. Phase 0 had already wiped 3 elements. CI checks (E2E+MCP) were green — they tested python code, NOT the live template shape.

**ANTIBODY (shipped `chore/wr2-pipeline-hardening-2026-05-10`):**
1. **Pre-flight validator** `scripts/wr2_validate_master.py` — exits non-zero if design missing, <11 usable pages, or <18 richtext elements (filter: `width >= 30`). Run before any commit bumping `TEMPLATE_DESIGN_ID`.
2. **Unit-test contract** `test_template_design_id_format` asserts constant matches `^DAH[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8}$`.
3. **Docstring header** on `TEMPLATE_DESIGN_ID` lists verification checklist.

**GOTCHA:**
- Phase 0 wipes master BEFORE Phase A detects mismatch — a wrong design ID means someone else's design gets blanked. Validator catches this pre-wipe; run it before every `TEMPLATE_DESIGN_ID` change.
- `start-editing-transaction` returns ALL richtext elements; renderer + validator both filter `width >= 30`. Change threshold in one → must change both (no programmatic link).
- `DAHJLYRn_3E` is kept in Canva (not trashed) as canonical failure example.
- Future template promotions: prefer designs that are verified clones of a working master.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: WR2 canva-apply path coupling between deploy worktree and main repo (2026-05-10)

_Discovered: 2026-05-10 03:50 WITA · Severity: P0 · Workaround SHIPPED in `chore/wr2-pipeline-hardening-2026-05-10`: skill reads `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` env var; production plist exports canonical path so deploy worktree and main repo align._

**TRAUMA:** Production cron runs `wr2_canva_desktop_apply.py` from deploy worktree `/Users/nuzantara/Desktop/nuzantara-deploy`; writes `canva_pending.json` there. The `/canva-apply` skill was hardcoded to read from the main repo path. Result: skill read a stale/absent file and silently timed out polling.

Temporary fix was a runtime symlink (fragile: destroyed by `git worktree remove`; invisible without `ls -la`).

**ANTIBODY (shipped):**
1. Skill reads `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` env var (fallback: legacy main-repo path). Plist exports `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` matching the writer side. Symlink no longer needed.
2. Snapshot copy at `infra/claude-skills/canva-apply.md` with CI drift check.
3. **Long-term TODO**: move output dir to `~/var/wr2/output/canva/` (out of git tree entirely).

**GOTCHA:**
- `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` must NOT have trailing slash. Plist value is normalized (skill strips on read).
- `wr2_canva_desktop_apply.py` reads `WR2_REPO_ROOT` (different var — repo root for venv+imports vs output dir). Don't conflate.
- Local skill at `~/.claude/skills/canva-apply.md` is NOT in git by default; iterate locally → commit to `infra/claude-skills/`.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: LegalIngestionService bypasses OpenAI 300k token batch limit (2026-05-10)

_Discovered: 2026-05-10 ~15:00 WITA during regulatory-ingest batch on 8 Indonesian regulations · Severity: P1 (silent data loss — reports success but 0 chunks created) · Workaround: skip files >2MB until embed batching shipped_

**TRAUMA:** `LegalIngestionService.ingest_legal_document()` → `EmbeddingsGenerator._embed_batch()` sends ALL chunks in a single OpenAI request. Hard limit: 300,000 tokens/request. On `400 max_tokens_per_request`, pipeline does NOT fatal-error: `_embed_batch()` returns partial/empty array → `HierarchicalIndexer._upsert_hierarchical_chunks()` gets mismatched lengths → `ValueError: chunks, embeddings… must have same length` → outer catch logs "Ingestion failed" but returns `{ok=True, chunks_created=0}`.

```
[done] Permenkumham 22/2023 → chunks=0 in 32s  ← reports "done" but ZERO chunks indexed
```

3 of 8 affected: Permenkumham 22/2023 (460k tokens), 11/2024 (11MB), Permen ATR/BPN 18/2021 (4.8MB). All three remain only in NotebookLM, NOT in Qdrant `legal_unified_2026`.

**ANTIBODY (proposed, NOT yet implemented):**
1. Split chunks into sub-batches of max 200k tokens (tiktoken `cl100k_base`) before OpenAI call.
2. `_embed_batch()` MUST raise on ANY 4xx; caller MUST verify `len(embeddings) == len(chunks)`.
3. CI test: synthetic >300k-token list → assert success with all chunks OR explicit `ValueError`, never silent `chunks_created=0`.

**Workaround:** `find -size -2M`; treat `chunks_created=0` as failure regardless of `status="ok"`.

**GOTCHA:**
- `ValueError: must have same length` looks like a chunker bug — it's upstream API rejection. Check OpenAI logs first.
- `{success: True, chunks_created: 0}` is the failure signature. Always check `chunks_created > 0`.
- Splitting PDFs manually is destructive (breaks BAB/Pasal hierarchy). Fix must be API-level batching.
- Files: `backend/core/embeddings.py`, `backend/core/legal/hierarchical_indexer.py`, `backend/services/ingestion/legal_ingestion_service.py`.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: 12+1 mata_garuda LaunchAgents active-active Pro+Mini (2026-05-07)

_Discovered: 2026-05-06 22:45 WITA during Symbiosis W1 genome enrollment audit · Severity: P1 · Workaround: TBD (cleanup follow-up PR)_

**TRAUMA:** 13 launchd labels fire SIMULTANEOUSLY on Pro AND Mini:
```
watcher.daily, reg-alert.30min, kg-linker, wr-topic, wr2-bridge.hourly,
bridge.adaptive, sentinel.daily, intel-bridge.daily, daily-briefing,
kita-feed.daily, public-channel, weekly-digest, gap.consumer
```
Blast radius: `regulation-alert.30min` sends duplicate Telegram alerts; `kg-linker` risks duplicate PG edges; `weekly-digest`/`daily-briefing` sent twice; `intel-bridge.daily` emits 2 distinct Redis entries with same OSINT content. Masked until 2026-05-04 because Mini was offline most of April.

**ANTIBODY (proposed, NOT yet implemented):**
1. Per-organ decision: (a) Pro-only, (b) Mini-only, or (c) leader-election. Default: Pro-only (canonical CRM + API tokens).
2. `launchctl bootout + rm plist` on losing side; update `organs_registry.yaml`.
3. Extend `wave1-pro-mini-dup-resolver.sh --resolve` to cover 13 labels.
4. CI test `test_genome_no_active_active.py` — scan `organs_registry.yaml` for shared labels across hosts, fail if outside explicit allowlist.

**GOTCHA:**
- `organs_registry.yaml` `duplicates_id` is HEADER-ONLY — validator does NOT enforce it.
- `--check` returns "0 conflicts" when Mini is offline → misleading. Only reliable when Mini is up.
- Metrics: `items_processed` inflated 2× until cleanup. Dashboard queries: filter by `host_pro_or_mini`.
- 13th entry `gap.consumer` reported as 12 in topology brief — verify with Zero if dup pair or Pro-only.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: NLM feeder split-brain — base_worker redis-cli has no host arg, prod has two local Redis instances (2026-05-06)

_Discovered: 2026-05-06 22:00 WITA · Patched same day, branch `fix/nlm-feeder-resurrect-2026-05-06` · Severity: P0_

**TRAUMA:** `apps/mata-garuda/mata_garuda/workers/base_worker.py` called `redis-cli` with no `-h`/`-p` flags → always hit `127.0.0.1`. After 2026-05-02 Modo B reorg, sentinel moved to Mini but feeder stayed on Pro. Pro Redis `garuda:alerts`: 258 entries, frozen since 2026-05-05. Mini Redis: fresh. Feeder consumed Pro's stale stream for ~36h; logs showed `processed=0, fed=0` — misread as "no new items". Compounding: 2 `sqlite3.OperationalError: disk I/O error` per 106 runs (WAL not enabled on `KnowledgeBase.__init__`).

Before fix (22:30 WITA): NB-INTEL-Immigration 61 sources, last updated 2026-05-04. After fix (23:00 WITA): +61 total sources across all 5 NB-INTEL notebooks.

**ANTIBODY (shipped):**
1. `base_worker.redis_cmd` reads `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST` + `GARUDA_REDIS_PORT` env vars; prepends `-h $host` to every redis-cli call. Unset → localhost (backward compat).
2. `KnowledgeBase.__init__` enables WAL + `synchronous=NORMAL` — lock contention waits on busy_timeout instead of crashing.
3. 9 new tests (`test_redis_host_override.py` + `test_knowledge_resilience.py`).
4. Mini Redis: `bind 127.0.0.1 ::1 100.93.236.6`, `protected-mode no`. Backup at `/opt/homebrew/etc/redis.conf.pre-tailscale-bind-2026-05-06`.
5. Pro plist gains `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST=100.93.236.6` in `EnvironmentVariables`. Reloaded via `launchctl bootout + bootstrap`.

**GOTCHA:**
- `redis-cli` does NOT honor `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST` — env var is ONLY for the Python wrapper. Debug: use `redis-cli -h $host` explicitly; verify via `INFO server | grep run_id` (Pro and Mini each have unique `run_id`).
- Env-var override only takes effect after `fix/nlm-feeder-resurrect-2026-05-06` merges to main; until then, hourly cron still reads Pro localhost.
- Future cross-host consumers MUST set `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST=100.93.236.6` — no auto-discovery.
- 753 nlm_fed dedup entries from pre-patch Pro era remain in `data/knowledge.db`. Overlapping URLs skipped on first cycle (visible as `skipped=N`) — correct, not a bug.
- `getcwd: cannot access parent directories` errors in launchd logs are RED HERRING from zsh `-l` startup; feeder works fine. Out of scope.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Test infrastructure mock != production stack (Sprint 1.B 2026-05-02, 3 hotfix in chain)

_Discovered: 2026-05-02 — 3 hotfix PRs (#423, #424) chained on PR #422 because tests were green but live endpoints failed · Severity: P1_

**TRAUMA:** PR #422 added `GET /api/channels/{name}/health` router. Unit tests 4/4 green. On prod:
1. `401` — `HybridAuthMiddleware` blocked path not in `PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS`. Test `_build_app_with_db_pool()` mounted router only, not middleware. Fixed by #423: added 4 entries to `_INFRA` group in `public_endpoints.py`.
2. `404` — router added to `router_manifest.py` but `router_registration.py` uses explicit imports, not the manifest. Fixed by #424: added `from backend.app.routers import channel_health` (×2) + `api.include_router(channel_health.router)` (×2).
3. After #424: 200 ✅. Timeline: 11:30 UTC (401) → 12:50 UTC (404) → 14:25 UTC (200).

**ANTIBODY (proposed, NOT yet implemented):**
1. Integration test `tests/integration/test_endpoints_reachable.py` — mount full `create_app()` via `httpx.AsyncClient`, GET every route; `404` → fail; `/health` returning `401` → flag for PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS review.
2. Manifest-vs-registration parity test `tests/setup/test_manifest_parity.py` — assert every `RouterEntry(name=X)` for `_API`/`_BOTH` has a matching `api.include_router(X.router)` in both include functions.
3. Extend `tests/test_public_endpoints_registry.py`: routes with `/health`/`/heartbeat` NOT in PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS → warning (not failure); silence with `# health-private: <reason>`.

**GOTCHA:**
- `_build_app_with_db_pool()` is intentionally minimal (no middleware) — correct for unit tests. Bug is absence of complementary integration layer.
- PR #422 is a regression of PRs #54/#55/#60 (same scar class). The manifest was created to prevent this but only catches symmetric include-function drift, not "manifest entry with zero include_router calls".
- `HybridAuthMiddleware.__init__` logs `Public Endpoints: N` at startup — grep-able sanity check on Fly machines.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Untracked files lost when sibling automation switches branches mid-session (2026-04-29, twice in 9h)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 21:42 WITA (incident #1) and 22:30 WITA (incident #2) · Partial mitigation: WIP-commit-every-10min · Permanent fix: TBD_

**TRAUMA:** Long-running sessions accumulate untracked files before commit threshold. Sibling processes (`nuz-sync`, parallel claude sessions, `agent-*` subagents `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) do `git stash` + `git checkout` automatically. `git stash` without `-u` does NOT stash untracked files → silent loss.

| Incident | Time | Producer | Lost | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #1 | 21:42 | `nuz-sync` watchdog auto-pull | 2 design docs ~17KB (never `git add`-ed) | Reconstructed from conversation context only |
| #2 | 22:30 | Parallel Claude session checking out `nbe/resend-fallback-team-templates` | 4 `.py` files ~26KB | Recovered from `.git/objects` dangling blobs (had been `git add`-ed) |

Incident #2 key sequence: Session-A wrote 4 untracked `.py` + 18/18 tests passing → 22:30:03 sibling stashes (tracked only) + checks out main → 22:30:06 checks out `nbe/*` → 4 files silently dropped → 22:32 Session-A diagnoses via `git fsck --dangling` → recovers to `/tmp/innervation-recovery-*/` → WIP commit `3980a1403`.

**ANTIBODY (partial — permanent fix pending):**

1. **WIP-commit-every-10min** whenever untracked files exist:
   ```bash
   if git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | grep -q .; then
     git add -A apps/<scope>/  # scope-limited, NOT bare `git add -A`
     git commit -m "WIP(<scope>): checkpoint $(date +%H:%M) — work in progress"
     git push origin "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
   fi
   ```
2. **Push within 30 seconds of commit** — no Write/Read tool calls between commit and push.
3. **Pre-session: `ps aux | grep claude | wc -l`** — if >2, STOP and ask Zero which to kill.
4. **Recovery**: `git fsck --dangling --no-reflogs 2>&1 | grep "dangling blob"` then `git cat-file -p <hash> > /tmp/recovery-<timestamp>/<filename>`. Only works if content was `git add`-ed. After ~14 days `git gc` may prune blobs.

**ANTIBODY (TBD):** Identify producer for 22:30 switch (suspects: PID 79949, PID 42807, wave-2/3 team agents). `nuz-sync` explicitly NOT enrolled in `organs_registry.yaml` — manual restart only until producer identified.

**GOTCHA:**
- A stash labeled `temp-<branch>` does NOT guarantee it contains all WIP — only tracked-dirty files. Always cross-check with `git fsck --dangling`.
- Files written via `Write` tool but never `git add`-ed have NO blob in `.git/objects` → unrecoverable via fsck. Only `git add`-ed content is recoverable.
- `/tmp/innervation-recovery-*` dirs are volatile (cleared on macOS reboot) — commit within minutes.
- `nuz-sync` is incident #1 suspect (fired at 21:42 inside 5-min cron tick) but NOT incident #2 (watchdog log shows it ran at 22:32:31, AFTER the hijack).

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Backend `/health` masks `app.state.startup_failed` (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit zero-crash · Severity: P0 · Workaround: TBD (P0-0 in `docs/audits/2026-04-29-zero-crash-audit/11_brainstorms/P0-0_health_endpoint_classify.md`)_

**TRAUMA:** `app_factory.py:114-118` catches RuntimeError from critical service init, sets `app.state.startup_failed=True`, returns. `health.py:48-55` defines `_check_startup_failed()` helper but `health_check()` at lines 147-266 NEVER CALLS IT. A broken backend returns HTTP 200 from `/health` forever — Fly auto-restart only fires on non-2xx. The 2026-04-29 03:11Z incident (login broken, machine in restart loop) is exactly this pattern.

**Compounding (BS-0b):** `apps/cell/cell/core/pulse.py` classifies green on `status_code == 200` — same blind spot.

**ANTIBODY (proposed):** Call `_check_startup_failed(request.app)` at top of `health_check()`, return 503; track `startup_started_at` with 180s warmup deadline; `pulse.py` classify on body status field (`unhealthy/startup_failed/failed/down` → red; `degraded/initializing/warming` → yellow).

**GOTCHA:** Do NOT `raise` in `_init_critical_services` (graceful degradation per Symbiosis Law 4) — without it uvicorn won't bind 8080. Warmup 180s assumes RAG cold-start ≤90-120s.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: EventBus is PG LISTEN/NOTIFY but Symbiosis docs say Redis Streams (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit · Severity: P0 · Phase 1 SHIPPED PR #342 (`0062090c4`); Phase 2 SHIPPED `feat/p0-2-fase2-callsite-refactor`; Phase 3 (per-handler ack + pruning cron) pending._

**TRAUMA:** `SYMBIOSIS.md` Law 4 promises "Redis Streams + consumer groups". Reality: EventBus uses **PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY** (`PG_CHANNEL_MAP`: `practice_changed`, `client_changed`, `compliance_alert`, `lkpm_ingest_completed`, `war_room_event`, `intel_event`, `cognitive_event`). When PG listener disconnects (5s window), every NOTIFY is **silently lost** — pg_notify is volatile, no queue.

**ANTIBODY phase 1 (PR #342):**
- New `events_outbox` table (migration 144). `outbox.py` exposes `publish`/`acknowledge`/`replay_unconsumed`/`prune_consumed`. `publish()` writes to outbox + fires `pg_notify($1, $2)` parameterised (**NOT** `quote_ident` — wrong for `pg_notify(text, text)`). `_outbox_id` injected into NOTIFY payload for idempotent ack.
- `EventBus._replay_outbox_on_reconnect` called after `add_listener`, before keep-alive loop.
- 20 unit tests (`test_outbox.py` + `test_event_bus_replay.py`).
- Phase-1 limit: `replay_unconsumed` auto-acks immediately after `dispatch_fn` returns; handler crash = event consumed. Phase 2 fixes.

**ANTIBODY phase 2 (feat/p0-2-fase2-callsite-refactor):**
- `EventBus.emit_pg` delegates to `outbox.publish` (local import, avoids circular init). Any future `emit_pg` call auto-writes to `events_outbox`.
- Migration `146_eventbus_triggers_use_outbox.sql`: rewrites 6 trigger functions (`notify_practice_change`, `notify_client_change`, `notify_compliance_alert`, `notify_war_room_event`, `notify_intel_event`, `notify_cognitive_event`) to `INSERT INTO events_outbox … RETURNING id` + `pg_notify(channel, payload||{_outbox_id})` inside the user transaction. Idempotent (`CREATE OR REPLACE`). ROLLBACK section restores pre-146 bodies.
- 12 new tests in `test_outbox_callsite_integration.py`.
- Channels out of scope: `lkpm_ingest_completed` (Python emitter, no DB trigger — picks up new path via `emit_pg`); `wr2_status_change` (not in PG_CHANNEL_MAP); `partner.commission_changed` (dotted name fails `validate_channel`, not in PG_CHANNEL_MAP — must be renamed `partner_commission_changed` first).

**ANTIBODY phase 3 (pending):** per-handler ack; pruning cron `prune_consumed` daily (30-day retention).

**Decision:** kept PG LISTEN/NOTIFY + Outbox. SYMBIOSIS.md doc update pending (low priority — code-as-truth). Redis Streams migration rejected as too risky for an audit fix.

**GOTCHA:**
- Migration 146 trigger wraps INSERT+NOTIFY in the SAME user transaction — rollback loses both (correct MVCC behavior). Disconnect after commit → outbox row stays unconsumed → replayed on reconnect.
- Consumers MUST be idempotent on `_outbox_id`. Phase 3 adds per-handler ack; until then `replay_unconsumed` auto-acks on `dispatch_fn` return.
- **`schema_migrations` is the active runner table (88 rows); `_schema_versions` is legacy (6 rows).** Future agents: always query `schema_migrations` to check migration status.
- `pg_notify($1, $2)` parameterised = injection-safe. Do NOT add `quote_ident($1)`.
- `events_outbox` is unbounded until phase 3. Manual: `await prune_consumed(conn, older_than_days=30)`.
- Migration 146 applies via post-deploy `run-sql-v2-migrations-post-deploy` job — no manual `workflow_dispatch` needed.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: 53 LaunchAgents Pro, only 7 (13%) have KeepAlive=true (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit zero-crash via Codex empirical scan · Severity: P0 · Workaround: TBD (P0-3 mass plist audit)_

**TRAUMA:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.{nuzantara,balizero,cell}.*.plist`. Codex counted 53 project plist: 7/53 (13%) `KeepAlive=true`, 11/53 no KeepAlive at all, 5/53 missing `EnvironmentVariables` (VADEMECUM §11 violation), 6/53 logging to `/tmp/` (lost on reboot). Critical daemons missing KeepAlive: `com.cell.organism`, `com.balizero.nlm-bridge`, `com.balizero.post-publish-poller`. Cell's crisis-recovery assumes daemon respawns within 10s.

**ANTIBODY (proposed):** P0-3 — `scripts/lint_launchagents.sh` + `scripts/patch_launchagents.sh --dry-run` + PreToolUse hook. Auto-classifies daemon-vs-cron by `StartInterval`/`StartCalendarInterval` presence.

**GOTCHA:** `RunAtLoad=true + no schedule` is ambiguous — manual review needed. Each plist gets `.pre-vademecum-audit` backup before patching. **After plist corruption hardening (see next scar): must `chmod u+w "$plist"` before patch scripts can run.**

---

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: SQL v2 migrations duplicate numbers `129_*` and `130_*` (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit zero-crash via Codex empirical scan · Severity: P0 · Workaround: rename non-applied duplicate (P0-7)_

**TRAUMA:** `apps/backend-rag/backend/db/migrations_v2/` has TWO files each for numbers `129` and `130`. Runner (`backend/db/migration_manager.py`) tracks via `migration_number` in `_schema_versions` — duplicates cause undefined apply order and silent corruption risk.

**ANTIBODY (proposed):** P0-7 — compare contents + git history, identify which is in `_schema_versions` (applied), rename the unapplied to next-available number. CI guardrail `lint-migration-numbers.yml` prevents regression. Migration runner asserts uniqueness in `discover_migrations()`.

**GOTCHA:** If both have been applied (unlikely): Zero handoff. Renaming changes file hash but not SQL content — apply order must be re-verified.

---

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Unknown agent overwrites loaded LaunchAgent plist files with JSON dump (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 ~15:30Z during P0-3 audit · Severity: P0 · Recovery automated; root cause UNKNOWN — escalation HIGH in `shared/escalations_pro.jsonl`_

**TRAUMA:** At 15:09:15-17 WITA, an unidentified process truncated **51 of 54** project plist files, replacing each XML with a tiny JSON fragment of one of the plist's own keys (e.g. `{"Hour":1,"Minute":0}` or the `EnvironmentVariables` object with secrets). Same event repeated at 16:05:18 (50 plist re-corrupted in <1s). Signature matches `plutil -extract <key> json stdout-redirect` pattern. Grep across all script dirs turned up zero matches — producer not a versioned script.

**Critical observation:** canary plist NOT loaded in launchd was NEVER corrupted — **producer enumerates `launchctl list` and writes per-label.**

On-disk corruption was masked (launchd serves cached boot config); **reboot would have lost 51 services** including `com.cell.organism`, `com.balizero.nlm-bridge`, all WR2 producers, all key cron jobs.

**Secrets leaked** into world-readable (0644) plist files:
- `post-publish-poller` → `GH_TOKEN`, `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, `SCRAPER_API_KEY`
- `post-publish-webhook` → `POST_PUBLISH_SECRET`
- `cell.organism` → `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `CELL_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `CELL_DATABASE_URL`
- `dlq-autopilot` + `sentinel` → `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

Rotation plan: `~/p0-3-recovery/secrets_rotation_plan.md`.

**ANTIBODY (recovery):** `~/p0-3-recovery/reconstruct_plist.py` parses `launchctl print gui/501/<label>` (in-memory config) and emits valid plist XML via `plistlib.dump`, validated with `plutil -lint`, atomic mv. 53/54 recovered in ~30s, zero service flap.

Recovery command:
```bash
python3 ~/p0-3-recovery/reconstruct_plist.py && \
for src in ~/p0-3-recovery/plist_reconstructed/com.*.plist; do
  chmod u+w "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/$(basename "$src")" 2>/dev/null
  install -m 0444 "$src" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
done
```

**ANTIBODY (prevention):**
1. **Filesystem hardening**: 5 plist with leaked secrets → `0400`; 49 remaining → `0444`. To edit: `chmod u+w "$plist"`, edit, restore mode.
2. **fs_usage audit** at `~/p0-3-recovery/fs_usage_trap/capture-*.log` — captures `WrData`/`O_TRUNC`/`truncate` on project plist. Check: `grep -E "WrData|O_TRUNC|truncate" ~/p0-3-recovery/fs_usage_trap/capture-*.log`. Stop: `sudo pkill -f "fs_usage -w -f filesys"`.

56-minute recurrence hypothesis **refuted** — no third wave by 18:44 WITA. Most likely: one-shot AI agent action (Antigravity/Cline/parallel Claude Code via filesystem MCP).

**GOTCHA:**
- Producer targets only launchd-loaded services. Unbootstrapped plist = safe canary, useless production state.
- `plutil -lint` fails on corrupted plist but launchd still serves cached boot XML. Don't equate lint-OK with service-OK.
- Most likely candidates: (a) parallel AI-agent session via filesystem MCP (Antigravity network activity at 15:09:05-13 supports this); (b) unknown binary with `plutil -convert` semantics; (c) launchd race from simultaneous `launchctl list`. 56-min cycle hypothesis refuted.
- After hardening, `patch_launchagents.sh --apply` MUST `chmod u+w` first — otherwise `plutil -insert/-replace` fails silently with `Operation not permitted`.

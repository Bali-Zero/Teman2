### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: PEL accumulation pattern recurs across Mata Garuda streams — no systematic recovery (2026-05-22)

_Discovered: 2026-05-22 08:50 WITA during W12 PEL survey post-W11 nlm_feeder cleanup · Severity: P2 · Status: **FIXED via weekly cron `com.matagaruda.pel-cleaner.weekly`**_

**TRAUMA:** Pattern observed in W11 (nlm_feeder `scan` ghost, 77 pending, 18d idle) and now W12 (nlm_feeder_alerts `debug-2` ghost, 5 pending, 17.9d idle) reveals a recurring failure mode: debug/test sessions create consumer names (`scan`, `debug-2`, `debug-trace`, `nlm_feeder-debug`) that crash mid-batch, leaving Pending Entries List (PEL) entries claimed by dead consumers forever. Standard Redis Streams behavior: messages stay in dead consumer's PEL unless XCLAIM'd or PEL is manually trimmed. W10 lag monitor (30min cron) surfaces the symptom but does not act on it. Manual XCLAIM cleanup (as done in W11) costs ~5 min per incident and requires operator awareness — does not scale. Empirical survey 2026-05-22 found 1 new instance in <12h since W11 cleanup (debug-2), confirming recurrence rate is non-trivial.

**ANTIBODY (shipped W12 same session):**

1. **`apps/mata-garuda/scripts/pel_cleaner.py`** (Python, stdlib-only per Mata Garuda CLAUDE.md §1.4 minimal deps). Scans all `garuda:*`/`bridge:*`/`nexus:*` Redis streams. For each consumer group:
   - **STALE_PEL** (`pending>0 AND idle>24h`): XCLAIM all pending messages from stale consumer to **youngest alive consumer** in the same group (lowest idle_ms, must be <24h idle). If no alive target exists: log error, leave alone (manual decision).
   - **GHOST_CONSUMER** (`pending=0 AND idle>30d`): `XGROUP DELCONSUMER`.
   - Idempotent: re-running on clean state = no-op. Exit 0 if no errors, 1 if any XCLAIM/DELCONSUMER errored.
2. **Wrapper** `~/scripts/matagaruda-pel-cleaner.sh` with W7 flock (`--nonblock --exclusive --conflict-exit-code 75`). TCC-safe: calls venv python directly.
3. **LaunchAgent** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.matagaruda.pel-cleaner.weekly.plist` — `StartCalendarInterval Weekday=0 Hour=4 Minute=0` (Sunday 04:00 WITA). Quiet cadence so manual ops can react during business days.
4. **Empirical smoke** 2026-05-22 08:57 WITA: cleaner XCLAIM'd 5 messages from `debug-2`→`nlm_feeder_alerts-1`. Re-run = no-op. Wrapper smoke = no-op. Plist kickstart = no-op + stderr empty (W8 split-stream lesson respected by reusing exit code semantics).
5. **Unit tests** `apps/mata-garuda/tests/test_pel_cleaner.py` (4/4 PASS): XINFO parser with two-consumer fixture, single-consumer fixture, empty fixture, threshold constants. Full mata-garuda test suite 935 passed + 1 pre-existing unrelated failure (`test_compat_shim.py` NB UUID drift).

**GOTCHA:**

- **Parser trap**: real Redis `XINFO CONSUMERS` output emits BOTH `idle` AND `inactive` fields per consumer (recent Redis versions). Naive parser closing record on `inactive` desynchronizes subsequent consumers' fields. Fix: close current record on `name` start (next consumer begins), not on field-end heuristic. Reference: `parse_xinfo_consumers` in `pel_cleaner.py:80`.
- **Alive threshold tension**: alert digest consumers (`nlm_feeder_alerts-1`) run on hourly+ cadence — initial 1h alive threshold misclassified them as ghosts. Relaxed to 24h. Future: if any consumer legitimately idles >24h between work (weekly archive worker?), threshold must be per-group.
- **Recurrence window**: cleaner runs weekly. If a debug session crashes Tuesday, PEL pollution lasts until Sunday. Acceptable trade-off vs noisy daily run on already-clean state. If operator wants faster: `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.matagaruda.pel-cleaner.weekly` ad-hoc.
- **`debug-2` post-XCLAIM state**: still exists with `pending=0` + idle 17.9d. Will be auto-deleted on next Sunday run when crossing the 30-day ghost threshold (around 2026-06-04). Until then, it shows in `XINFO CONSUMERS` as harmless zero-pending entry.
- **nexus-bridge orphan group** (W11 deferred): unchanged. `bridge-worker-1` consumer is `pending=0 + idle=12d` → does NOT trigger ghost threshold (30d). Will surface for cleaner consideration only after 2026-06-21. Antonello decision still pending (DELETE group / RESTORE worker / LEAVE).
- **W11 nlm_feeder-1 drainage** (W11 follow-up): 82 pending still at 08:57 WITA (no drain yet). Next `com.matagaruda.nlm-feeder-stream.hourly` fire ~09:00 WITA will start drainage. Independent of W12 cleaner (alive consumer, not eligible for XCLAIM).

**Reference**: `research/operations/2026-05-22-pel-cleaner-weekly-cron.md` (next commit). Wrapper exit codes: 0=clean, 1=errors, 75=concurrent instance blocked.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Wave 1 orchestration fix shipped 3 hidden defects caught only by devils-advocate (2026-05-22)

_Discovered: 2026-05-22 02:55 WITA during devils-advocate gate post-Wave 1 build · Severity: P0 (security regression masked as feature) · Status: **PATCHED in-band, all 13 post-patch tests PASS**_

**TRAUMA:** Wave 1 of orchestration-regression-fix shipped 5 antibodies (T1.1 dispatch_nudge hook, T1.2 guardrails daemon+static+client+plist, T1.3 feedback memory, T1.4 karpathy skill, T1.5 alzheimer verify). All 5 individually passed acceptance criteria + verbose Spec-described smoke tests. Devils-advocate red-team pass discovered THREE silent defects that would have shipped to prod:

1. **T1.2 H5 (CRITICAL):** `MCP_DESTRUCTIVE_PATTERN` regex (iter-5 lookahead) blocked **22/44 = 50% of nuzantara-mcp toolset** as false positives — including routine `create_client`, `create_practice`, `update_client`, `notebook_create`, `note_update`, `set_reminder`. The Spec-promoted verb list (`create|update|merge|deploy|promote|rollback|cancel|rerun|insert|modify|patch|set|write|alter`) was overbroad for the production reality where 90% of MCP "create_*" tools are routine CRM ops, not destructive. Bali Zero CRM workflows would have crashed on first real use within hours of deploy.

2. **T1.1 H2 (HIGH):** `DISPATCH_KEYWORDS = ("Task(", '"subagent_type"', "Agent(")` — the string `"Agent("` appears **0 times** in actual Claude Code transcripts (empirically scanned 1955 lines, 3.1MB). Real tool_use blocks store `{"name": "TaskCreate"}` not `Agent(...)` Python-call syntax. Hook would have triggered false-positive nudges in sessions where TaskCreate was actually dispatched, training Antonello to ignore the reminder.

3. **T1.5 H6 (MEDIUM):** alzheimer-hook had `STATE_KEY="${MFILE//\//_}_${TODAY_KEY}"` path-based dedup. Empirical discovery: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-nuzantara/memory/MEMORY.md` and `~/.claude/projects/-Users-nuzantara-Desktop-nuzantara/memory/MEMORY.md` share **inode 123213483** (same file, 2 access paths). Path-string dedup → 2× Telegram alerts per threshold breach, trains operator to ignore alerts.

4. **T1.2 H1 (MEDIUM, documentation-only):** `settings.json` hook changes do NOT take effect mid-session — they require Claude Code session restart. No empirical proof guardrails covered Wave 1's own construction calls in this session. Could ship guardrails that LOOK active but don't fire until next session.

5. **Bonus discovery during T1.2 implementation**: macOS `nc` (BSD/Apple) does NOT support `-N` flag (GNU netcat extension). The original Spec's `nc -U -N -w 2 $SOCK` recipe fails on macOS with `nc: invalid tcp adaptive write timeout value`. Forced switch to inline Python UNIX socket client. Latency: spec-promised median 4.8ms nc, empirically Python socket is **0.9ms median** (5× faster than spec claim).

**ANTIBODY (shipped in same Wave 1 commit):**

1. **Patch 1 (H5):** Narrowed `MCP_DESTRUCTIVE_PATTERN` to `(delete|drop|truncate|destroy|remove|wipe|purge)(?=_|$|[A-Z])`. Removed 15 routine verbs. Bypass for actually-dangerous create ops (pr_create, deploy_to_vercel) retained via explicit `MCP_DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS` set. 13/13 post-patch regex tests PASS (8 false-positive guards + 5 security regression guards).

2. **Patch 2 (H2):** `DISPATCH_KEYWORDS = ('"name":"TaskCreate"', '"name": "TaskCreate"', '"subagent_type"', '"name":"Task"', '"name": "Task"')` — matches actual JSON transcript format. 3/3 post-patch synthetic transcript tests PASS.

3. **Patch 3 (H6):** alzheimer-hook now uses `INODE=$(stat -f%i "$MFILE" || stat -c%i "$MFILE")` for cross-platform inode, `STATE_KEY="inode_${INODE}_${TODAY_KEY}"`. Dedup is now correct even when 2 paths share inode.

4. **Patch 4 (H1):** Document deployment trap — settings.json hooks require session restart. Add `--verify` step to runbook.

**GOTCHA:**

- The MCP regex hallucination is the SECOND time iter-1/iter-2/iter-5 design failed in the same spec — original spec had `[_$]` (broken), iter-2 had `\b` (Gemini Deep Think GDT-3 caught), iter-5 had explicit lookahead (worked syntactically) but had wrong VERB LIST (this scar). Three rounds of regex spec failure on a single component proves: **devils-advocate gate is non-negotiable for any guardrails-layer regex change**. Spec authors cannot self-validate adversarial regex with markdown test tables — only empirical execution against real-world tool names catches the over-blocking.
- macOS BSD nc vs GNU nc divergence: when porting hook scripts across platforms, the `nc -N` recipe is a non-portable trap. Python `socket` module is universally available + dependency-free + faster.
- Same-inode file paths in `~/.claude/projects/` likely a filesystem mountpoint trick or symlink-disguised-as-dir setup — verify with `stat -f%i` before assuming 2 paths = 2 files.
- mid-session settings.json edit deployment ambiguity: until Anthropic documents hot-reload behavior, ALWAYS assume settings.json hooks need session restart. Plan deploys as "edit settings, restart Claude, run verification call, then proceed with feature use."

**Reference**: `research/operations/specs/T1.1-dispatch-nudge-hook.md` + `T1.2-guardrails-hook.md` (1900 lines, 5 iter) + `T1.5-alzheimer-diagnose-script.md` + this session devils-advocate red-team output.

### ✅ RESOLVED / FALSE-ALARM: T0.2 spec premise "nuzantara-mcp DNS resolution failed" was stale SessionStart diagnostic (2026-05-22)

_Discovered: 2026-05-22 ~01:10 WITA during T0.2 worker execution · Severity: P0 (per spec, but moot in reality) · Status: **NO FIX NEEDED — server already connected**_

**TRAUMA:** Spec T0.2 (promoted from T3.1 by DS panel sequencing 2026-05-21 22:00) declared all 115 `mcp__nuzantara-mcp__*` tools dead due to DNS failure on `nuzantara-rag.fly.dev`. Empirical re-verification 2026-05-22 01:10 WITA:

```
$ claude mcp list | grep nuzantara-mcp
nuzantara-mcp: /Users/nuzantara/Desktop/nuzantara/apps/nuzantara-mcp/.venv/bin/python apps/nuzantara-mcp/nuzantara_mcp/server.py - ✓ Connected

$ claude mcp get nuzantara-mcp
nuzantara-mcp:
  Scope: Project config (shared via .mcp.json)
  Status: ✓ Connected

$ <mcp__nuzantara-mcp__check_health>
{"status":"healthy","version":"v100-qdrant","database":{"status":"connected","type":"postgresql"},"embeddings":{"status":"operational","model":"text-embedding-3-small","dimensions":1536}}

$ dig +short nuzantara-rag.fly.dev
66.241.124.44
77.83.141.51

$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m 5 https://nuzantara-rag.fly.dev/health
200
```

The spec premise was wrong on two counts:

1. **Transport conflation**: `nuzantara-mcp` uses **stdio transport** (local Python subprocess: `apps/nuzantara-mcp/.venv/bin/python ... server.py`), per `.mcp.json` and CLAUDE.md §7. The Python child process talks to `nuzantara-rag.fly.dev` over HTTPS via `NUZANTARA_API_KEY` — DNS failure inside the child would manifest as **tool call errors**, not as the MCP server itself being unreachable. The MCP stdio handshake works regardless of upstream backend DNS.
2. **Stale SessionStart signal**: the SessionStart MCP-readiness probe likely sampled during a transient DNS hiccup, OR it was probing the HTTPS backend health (not the stdio child), OR the worker who wrote the spec was reading an old hook output. By the time T0.2 was promoted (22:00), the state had already recovered.

`mcp__nuzantara-mcp__check_health_detailed` shows the backend in **degraded** state (search/ai/router unavailable on the rag-process group), but that is an orthogonal concern, NOT a DNS issue — it's the same rag worker-process gap that exists independently of MCP transport.

**ANTIBODY (no shipping required — observational hardening only):**

1. **Diagnostic discipline**: future SessionStart MCP-readiness lines should distinguish (a) stdio child handshake (b) upstream HTTPS backend reachability (c) per-tool first-call latency. Conflating them produces false P0s like this one.
2. **Spec promotion guard**: DS panel sequencing decisions should require a second empirical probe (≤5 min before promotion) to confirm the symptom is still live. T0.2 was promoted ~17 hours after the original diagnosis — plenty of time for transient state to recover.
3. **MCP listing as canonical**: `claude mcp list` is the single source of truth for server connection state. If it shows `✓ Connected`, the server is reachable via stdio. Per-tool health is a separate concern reachable only via actual tool invocation.

**GOTCHA:**

- `mcp__nuzantara-mcp__check_health` returns 200 even when `check_health_detailed` shows critical services down (search/ai). That's by design — the MCP server itself is up, even when its dependencies are degraded. Do not use top-level `check_health` as a proxy for service readiness.
- The 115 tool count cited in spec (and CLAUDE.md §7) is the manifest definition; deferred-tool-list during this session showed ~170+ entries because newer tools were added since CLAUDE.md was last updated.
- The `check_health_detailed` "critical": ["search", "ai"] result is a real P1-ish backend issue (orthogonal to MCP transport): the rag worker process group does not have search/AI initialized. Worth its own spec if not already covered by Wave 1.

**Verification commands** (anyone can re-run):

```bash
claude mcp list 2>&1 | grep nuzantara-mcp        # Expect: ✓ Connected
claude mcp get nuzantara-mcp                      # Expect: Status: ✓ Connected
# Then in Claude session: mcp__nuzantara-mcp__check_health   → 200 OK
```

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: `apps/cell/.env` unquoted multi-token value silent-aborts `launch_cell.sh` under `set -e` (2026-05-22)

_Discovered: 2026-05-22 00:00 WITA during Cell daemon resurrection (worktree audit-cell-genoma-organism-2026-05-21) · Severity: P1 · Status: **RESOLVED** (quote-fix applied + Python normalizer; reproducible via audit installer)_

**TRAUMA:** Cell core daemon (`com.cell.organism`) had been silent since 2026-05-16 08:01 WITA (5.5 giorni). Audit phase concluded the cause was "plist not installed in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`". Re-bootstrap via `apps/cell/scripts/install_cell_daemon.sh` succeeded the install step but daemon entered `spawn scheduled` + `last exit code = 1` immediately. `/tmp/cell.stderr.log` revealed `bash: /Users/nuzantara/Desktop/nuzantara/apps/cell/.env: line 5: fm2_lJP...,fm2_lJP...: No such file or directory`.

Root cause: `FLY_API_TOKEN=FlyV1 fm2_xxx==,fm2_yyy==` in `.env` had:
- Space between `FlyV1` and the first token segment → `set -a; source .env` assigns `FLY_API_TOKEN=FlyV1`, then tries to **execute** `fm2_xxx==,fm2_yyy==` as a command;
- `,` in middle of the token → bash interprets `fm2_xxx==,fm2_yyy==` as a path (the `/` inside the base64-ish content) → "no such file or directory";
- `launch_cell.sh` has `set -euo pipefail` → ANY error in `source` aborts the entire wrapper with exit 1 → launchd marks daemon failed, retries, same crash → loop;
- Earlier interactive dry-run during audit Phase 5 used the SAME `set -a; source .env; set +a` but the parent shell had **no** `set -e`, so it survived the same error (only printed the warning and assigned the truncated value). This created a **FALSE POSITIVE empirical signal** that "the code works manually" — it doesn't, when invoked under launchd's strict-mode wrapper.

Hidden for 5.5 days because:
1. The daemon was never re-installed after being uninstalled (date unknown — likely 2026-04-29 plist-corruption episode or post-handoff cleanup);
2. `cell-observatory` collector kept showing "no new cell pulses" but the symptom was attributed to missing daemon, not to `.env` parsing;
3. The historic plist (still in `~/p0-3-recovery/plist_reconstructed/`) bypassed this by inlining env vars in the plist `EnvironmentVariables` dict — which is exactly the P0 secret-leak posture we want to avoid.

**ANTIBODY (shipped):**

1. **Quote-fix `.env` line 5**: backup at `apps/cell/.env.pre-quote-fix-2026-05-21`, line rewritten as `FLY_API_TOKEN="FlyV1 fm2_xxx==,fm2_yyy=="`. Verified via `bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; set -a; source apps/cell/.env; set +a; echo ${#FLY_API_TOKEN}'` returns 687 (full token length).
2. **Python normalizer** (one-shot, ad-hoc): iterates lines, detects values containing `[\s,;|&<>(){}*?\\]`, wraps with double quotes after escaping any embedded `"`. Lives inline in the bootstrap session for now — could be promoted to `apps/cell/scripts/validate_env.py` if recurring.
3. **Daemon empirical verification**: `Pulse #1 complete. Health: green` at 23:58:44, `Pulse #2 complete. Health: green` at 23:59:56, PID 48494 stable. Cell SelfModel age=56d pulses=39911 actions=20217 resumed from EpisodicMemory.

**GOTCHA:**

- Phase 5 of the audit (interactive dry-run from `set -a; source .env`) returned green INFO logs and made the "code works" claim plausible. The bug only manifests when invoked from a wrapper that uses `set -e`. **Generalize**: dry-running env-loading code WITHOUT `set -e` does not prove launchd behavior. Always test under the same shell flags as production wrapper (`bash -c 'set -euo pipefail; ./launch_cell.sh' </dev/null`).
- `.env` line was added by someone manually copying the FLY token output of `fly auth token` — that command emits the token with a leading `FlyV1 ` prefix (space-separated). The token format itself is the issue.
- `apps/cell/.env.example` does NOT include `FLY_API_TOKEN` (audited 2026-05-22). Future onboarding will hit the same trap. Consider adding `FLY_API_TOKEN="FlyV1 <token>"` to `.env.example` with explicit quoting demonstration.
- This scar is adjacent to but DIFFERENT from the 2026-05-21 P0 password leak: that one is about secrets-in-tracked-files, this one is about whitespace handling in untracked secrets. Same `.env`, different failure mode.

**Reference**: bootstrap session log = `/tmp/cell.stderr.log` (initial crash trace), worktree `audit-cell-genoma-organism-2026-05-21` audit report (this commit's body).

### ℹ️ INFO: Cell pulse → `cell_pulse_observed` PG channel emit gated by `CELL_OBSERVATORY_EMIT=true` (2026-05-22)

_Discovered: 2026-05-22 00:05 WITA during Cell daemon resurrection · Severity: INFO (by design, not a bug) · Status: behavior documented_

**TRAUMA:** Not really a trauma — by design. After Cell daemon was successfully resurrected (cicatrix above), the empirical check on `~/.cell-observatory/observatory.db` showed `count(*) WHERE cell_id='cell' AND pulse_timestamp > NOW() - 5min = 0` despite the daemon emitting `Pulse #1` and `Pulse #2` green internally. The pulse loop runs fine; the bridge to PG `cell_pulse_observed` channel is conditional on env var `CELL_OBSERVATORY_EMIT=true` (gate in `apps/cell/cell/core/pulse.py:803` and `packages/cell-core/...`).

Without the flag: Cell pulses internally, sensors fire, cortex thinks, actions taken — but no row in `events_outbox` channel `cell_pulse_observed`, no row in `pulse_events` SQLite. Observability gap, not a functional gap.

**Historic context**: `~/.cell-observatory/observatory.db` shows `cell_id='cell'` pulses from 2026-05-02 to 2026-05-16 (~14925 rows). Someone HAD set `CELL_OBSERVATORY_EMIT=true` historically. It was removed (silently — `.env` does not contain the variable now) at some point coincident with the daemon being uninstalled.

**ANTIBODY (deferred):**

- Decision pending operator (Antonello): set `CELL_OBSERVATORY_EMIT=true` in `apps/cell/.env` to restore historical observability? Cost: 1 row per pulse in `events_outbox` (~1380/day, persistent table) + 1 row in SQLite + Redis stream bytes. Benefit: dashboard continuity, anomaly detection, weekly Cell health reports.
- If yes: add line to `.env`, `launchctl bootout + bootstrap` to pick up new env. Verify with `sqlite3 ~/.cell-observatory/observatory.db "SELECT count(*) FROM pulse_events WHERE cell_id='cell' AND pulse_timestamp/1000 > strftime('%s','now') - 600"` within 5 min.
- Mention also in `apps/cell/launchagent/README.md` resurrection section so the variable is not lost on future re-bootstraps.

**GOTCHA:**

- This is a "silent observability gap" — daemon is technically healthy, dashboards just don't see it. Easy to miss in audits because `launchctl print` shows `state = running`, no exit codes, no crash logs.
- The 14925 historic rows from before 2026-05-16 are NOT regenerated retroactively when the flag is re-enabled; they remain frozen as snapshot. Trend continuity gap is permanent unless backfill is scripted.

### 🚨 P0 SECURITY: Postgres prod password `backend_rag_v2` hardcoded in 32 files repo public — 5 months exposure (2026-05-21)

_Discovered: 2026-05-21 ~05:00 WITA during PR #802 admin-override review · Severity: **P0** · Status: **OPEN — awaiting rotation decision by Antonello**_

**TRAUMA:** Password `<REDACTED — see incident report>` per role `backend_rag_v2` (Fly Postgres `nuzantara-postgres.flycast`, production database Nuzantara) hardcoded in plaintext in **32 file** del repo public `Balizero1987/Teman2`:

- 23 file su `apps/backend-rag/scripts/` (CRM/OCR/KG/migration scripts)
- 4 file su `scripts/workspace_automation/` (sibling commit `d82df9de5` 2026-05-20 ha aggiunto questi 4 con `# pragma: allowlist secret` bypass tentativo)
- 1 in `apps/backend-rag/migrations/migration_066_*.py`
- 1 in `apps/backend-rag/.env` (workspace local, ma tracked)
- 1 in `apps/cell/cell/core/config.py`
- 1 in `apps/evaluator/seo_auto_fixer.py`
- 1 in `scripts/extract_worker.sh`

**Esposizione**: commit più vecchio con questo segreto = `86ee1b71c33a692` (2025-12-19, "Refactoring main_cloud.py + Git repo recovery"). Repo public dal quel momento = **5 mesi di esposizione** su GitHub. Credenziali potenzialmente:
- Già scraped da GitHub secrets indexers (GitGuardian, TruffleHog, GitHub built-in secret scanners)
- Nel training set di model commerciali (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google crawl GitHub public)
- Indicizzata su Google Dorks
- Su archive.org cloni / forks GitHub

`localhost:15432` è il proxy fly-pg-proxy-wrapper.sh → tunnel su `nuzantara-postgres.flycast` Fly internal — quindi password produzione, non solo dev.

**CI Detect Secrets gate fail di PR #802** ha correttamente flaggato 4 dei file (gli altri 28 sono già "allowlisted" da audit precedente → detect-secrets baseline `.secrets.baseline` li ignora). Claude Opus 4.7 ha fatto **admin override** del gate senza ispezionare il contenuto, categorizzando "pre-existing = OK". Quando Antonello ha challengiato "perché dici OK?", verifica empirica ha rivelato il leak.

**ANTIBODY (NOT YET shipped — decisione operativa pending Antonello)**:

Opzione A (raccomandata): rotate password + scrub repo
1. `fly ssh console -a nuzantara-postgres` → run an `ALTER USER backend_rag_v2` statement to set a freshly generated credential (see incident report for exact procedure)
2. Update Fly secrets via `fly secrets set` per nuzantara-rag + altri consumer (the new connection string)
3. Patch 32 file: replace hardcoded password con `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` lookup
4. Update local `.env` files + LaunchAgent env (fly-pg-proxy-wrapper.sh, ecc.)
5. `git filter-repo --replace-text` o BFG Repo-Cleaner per scrub history (force-push main richiesto — coordinare con team)
6. Telegram alert team + dispatch incident report

Opzione B (parziale, deferred): rotate solo + commit normale (skip history scrub — password storica resta nei commit storici, ma non più utilizzabile dopo rotate)

Opzione C (status quo, scelta 2026-05-21): solo scar + report, no action immediata. Password resta valida + esposta.

**GOTCHA:**

- `# pragma: allowlist secret` aggiunto dal sibling commit `d82df9de5` ai 4 file workspace_automation non funziona perché detect-secrets richiede ALSO audit nel baseline file. Il pragma da solo non basta — è anti-pattern (tentativo silenziare guard senza fix root cause).
- Repo `Balizero1987/Teman2` è public. Privatizzarlo NON rimuove le password dai mirror/clone esistenti.
- `apps/backend-rag/.env` è tracked in git (PR `5751a6b23b` 2026-01-11 "security: remove tracked private keys and fix .gitignore" ha rimosso .env da .gitignore — bug regressivo).
- 28 file su 32 sono "allowlisted" da audit precedente → `pip install detect-secrets && detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline` mostra che la community ha visto + accettato i finding "is_secret: true" o "is_secret: false" senza rotation. Audit fatto malamente — accettare un secret in plaintext non lo rende sicuro.
- `apps/backend-rag/backend/services/monitoring/health_monitor.py:278-291` ha comment block che cita esplicitamente `backend_rag_v2` come role name — questa è OK (no password), ma rivela il role name a chi avesse accesso solo a una parte del codebase.

**Meta-incident (Claude Opus 4.7)**: violazione 3 regole durante PR #802 review iniziale:
1. CLAUDE.md §"Anti-hallucination discipline" rule 2 — verifica con secondo tool call indipendente prima di citare risultati critici. Non eseguito sul CI fail.
2. AUTONOMOUS_OPS.md L2 — admin override su CI gate richiede investigazione contenuto + report. Bypassed.
3. SYMBIOSIS.md Legge 5 (Zero come ultima istanza) — decisione strutturale di bypass security gate doveva essere escalata.

**Reference incident report**: `research/operations/2026-05-21-postgres-password-leak-incident.md` (commit `b26ba636d` on main).

1. **`GDRIVE_COMPANIES_FOLDER_ID` pointed to a ghost folder.** The Fly secret had value `1PGRBCSzXc8T3LYqEB1-hucBaH2YW77Av` — folder never existed (or was deleted long ago). Every `client_type='company'` creation triggered `ServiceAccountDriveService.create_client_folder` → `files.create(parents=[ghost_id])` → `404 File not found` → exception swallowed by `BackgroundTask` try/except → API returned 201 to the client, silently no folder. No alert, no Sentry (or PII-redacted), no metric. ~30 company clients orfani in DB.
2. **`wa-mirror-auto-promote-leads.py` and `wa-mirror-dash` bypass the API router.** Both do `INSERT INTO clients (...) created_by='wa-mirror-auto-promote'` directly via asyncpg, never call `POST /api/clients`, so `create_client_folder` BackgroundTask is never scheduled. 5/7 recent orphans were wa-mirror leads.

Empirical scope last-60d (2026-05-21 audit):
| created_by | drive/total |
|---|---|
| `wa-mirror-*` | 0/5 (100% miss) |
| UI (`zero@`, `adit@`, `krisna@`, `ari.firda@`) on `company` | 0/7 (100% miss — phantom secret) |
| UI on `individual` | OK (parent `Individual_CRM` valid) |
| `system-import` (legacy) | 0/16 — fuori scope |

**ANTIBODY (shipped 2026-05-21 — commit `1a3824b39`):**

1. **Secret rotation** — `fly secrets set GDRIVE_COMPANIES_FOLDER_ID=1rLlr2G7TdNUmmvQ_xN9pZQLbPrDFjUsW -a nuzantara-rag` → punta ora a `BALI ZERO/CRM/Company_CRM`, deployed + machine restart verified.
2. **Backfill** — `/tmp/backfill_drive_folders_v2.py` (run inside Fly api machine `7847d95ce257d8`): re-runs `ServiceAccountDriveService.create_client_folder` for clients with `google_drive_folder_id IS NULL`. 14 clients backfillati (7 individual + 7 company post-rotation). Tutti hanno 6 sottocartelle top-level in `client_drive_subfolders` table.
3. **Startup validation** — `ServiceAccountDriveService.__init__` ora chiama `_validate_configured_folders()` che fa un `files.get()` su ciascuno dei 3 parent ID (`GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID`, `GDRIVE_INDIVIDUALS_FOLDER_ID`, `GDRIVE_COMPANIES_FOLDER_ID`). Log ERROR a boot se 404/trashed/inaccessibile — visibilità immediata di future rotation a ID malformati.
4. **Sentry capture** — `BackgroundTask` Drive ora avvolto in `_create_drive_folder_with_observability` (crm_clients.py): `sentry_sdk.capture_exception` con tag `subsystem=drive_folder_create` e `client_type`. PII già redacted via `sentry_config.py:_before_send` (scar 2026-04-21). Silent failure → P2 ticket.
5. **Service-to-service endpoint** — `POST /api/crm/clients/{id}/ensure-drive-folder` (idempotente: returns `{"created": false}` se già esiste). Auth via JWT user OR `X-Internal-Key` header (settings `wa_mirror_internal_key`). `~/scripts/wa-mirror-auto-promote-leads.py` aggiornato per chiamare l'endpoint dopo INSERT con key letta da `~/.wa-mirror.env`. 6 unit test coprono route registration, idempotency, create-when-missing, 404 on missing client.

**ANTIBODY (deferred):**

- **Periodic reconciliation cron.** Daily job: `SELECT count(*) FROM clients WHERE google_drive_folder_id IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'` → if > 0 → Telegram alert. Catches future regressions in <24h instead of being discovered only when user asks "perché manca?". Non shipped — opzione (b) outbox event-driven preferita ma scope creep.
- **25 storici orfani** (16 `system-import` + 9 `created_by IS NULL`) deliberatamente fuori scope. Da fare con script targeted se/quando emergono in workflow.

**GOTCHA:**

- Per la rotation: `fly secrets set` mette in `staged`, MUST poi `fly secrets deploy` per applicare alle machines. `fly secrets set --stage` lascia esplicito che è staged; senza `--stage` Fly fa restart automatico (anche più veloce).
- L'errore 404 di Drive sembra "permanent" ma in realtà se la cartella esiste ma il service account non è stato condiviso, l'errore è IDENTICO (`File not found`). Modo per distinguere: prova `files.get(supportsAllDrives=true)` impersonando user con accesso (es. `zero@balizero.com`) vs senza DWD.
- `ServiceAccountDriveService` su Fly usa `Domain-wide delegation` impersonando `zero@balizero.com` (vedi log `"✅ Using Domain-wide delegation, impersonating: zero@balizero.com"`). Quindi le folder devono essere accessibili a `zero@balizero.com` (non al SA email diretto). La nuova `Company_CRM` lo è perché è dentro `BALI ZERO/CRM` di proprietà di Zero.
- `Individual_CRM` esiste sotto `BALI ZERO/CRM` parent `1je2YOEzBf2APKDbAdaXo2MGIu4N5nAEl` ed è correttamente referenziato dal secret. La gerarchia attesa è `BALI ZERO/CRM/{Individual_CRM,Company_CRM,Archive_CRM}` — verificato listing 2026-05-21.
- Esistono 39 active orphans totali (14 backfillati + 16 `system-import` + 9 `created_by IS NULL`). I 25 storici NON sono nello scope di questo fix.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Intel Lake routing prefix-blind for subdomains (2026-05-20)

_Discovered: 2026-05-20 03:00 WITA durante Phase A audit · Patched PR-B1a `feat/intel-lake-2stage-routing-2026-05-20` · Severity: P1_

**TRAUMA:** Phase A audit ha trovato che **90% intel_items finivano in `needs_review`** invece di essere classificati. Producer scraper inviava `source_domain="kompas.com"` o `tempo.co` ma le rules in `intel_lake_router.py` matchavano solo TLD diretto, non sotto-dominii (es. `nasional.kompas.com` → unmatched). Effetto: la coda `needs_review` cresceva quotidianamente di ~50 items/day, router silently skipping. Compounding: SSOT JSON (`~/scripts/intel-lake-routing-rules.json`) deviava dal Python backend (`_RULES` in `intel_lake_router.py`) — Pro-local router cron usava JSON, Fly backend usava Python. 4-LLM panel verdict (Gemini + Codex 3/3 convergent): rules troppo restrittive, non un bug pipeline.

**ANTIBODY (shipped feat/intel-lake-2stage-routing-2026-05-20):**

1. **2-stage routing**: domain match (con `_SUBDOMAIN_PREFIX = r"(?:[a-z0-9-]+\.)*"` regex tollerante) → keyword content match → classifica. `_PRESS_GENERAL_RE` apre la lista press, ma deve poi ottenere un match in `_PRESS_REGULATORY_KEYWORDS` (visa/kitas/pajak/pmk/kbli/...) per andare a `nb-intel/press`. Gov rules restano STRICT (security: non vuoi `nasional.kompas-fake.com` che si dichiari `kemenkumham.go.id`).
2. **Shadow mode**: env `INTEL_LAKE_ROUTING_SHADOW=1` → calcola classifica ma non muta DB. Permette A/B test live.
3. **SSOT reconciliation**: `~/scripts/intel-lake-routing-rules.json` _meta.version bumped to 2, `synced_from_backend_at = 2026-05-20`. Nota corretta: in-process router IS attivo, `DISABLE_BACKGROUND_WORKERS` NON è settato in prod.
4. **`backfill_needs_review(dry_run=True)`** helper: ri-classifica retroattivamente la coda `needs_review` con le nuove rules. Default dry_run per safety. 49/49 unit test pass.

**GOTCHA:**

- `_PRESS_GENERAL_RE` deve mai includere `.go.id` o `kemenkumham/*` — quelli sono gov authoritative, lì TLD strict. Mix-up = fake gov authority bypass.
- `_SUBDOMAIN_PREFIX` regex usa `(?:...)` non-capturing — non rompere `re.match(_PRESS_GENERAL_RE, domain).group(0)` (non c'è group, usa `.group(0)`).
- Backfill cron NON è attivo automaticamente — solo invocato manualmente da Antonello via `python -m backend.services.intel.intel_lake_router --backfill`.

### ✅ RESOLVED: outbox-drain stderr noise (2026-05-20)

_Discovered: 2026-05-13 audit `~/logs/intel-lake-outbox-drain.err` 841KB · **RESOLVED** PR-B2 2026-05-20 `chore/outbox-drain-log-routing-2026-05-20`_

**TRAUMA:** `/Users/nuzantara/scripts/intel-lake-outbox-drain.py` usava `logging.basicConfig` default che routa ogni livello a stderr. `.err` log cresceva indefinitamente (~841KB in 7 giorni) con INFO routinari "idle (pending=N delivered=M)" che Pro launchd cattura come "stderr → errore". Effetto: false-alarm fatigue, vero WARN/ERROR sepolti.

**ANTIBODY (shipped):**

Split-stream handlers: `_stdout_handler` filtra `< WARNING` (INFO/DEBUG → stdout `.log`), `_stderr_handler` filtra `>= WARNING` (WARN/ERROR → stderr `.err`). Stesso formatter, root logger ha entrambi handlers.

```python
_stdout_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
_stdout_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
_stdout_handler.addFilter(lambda r: r.levelno < logging.WARNING)
_stderr_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stderr)
_stderr_handler.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

**GOTCHA:** se aggiungi un nuovo handler (es: Sentry), va aggiunto a `logging.root.handlers = [...]` esplicito, non basta `addHandler`. Il root logger `.handlers = []` riscrive l'intera lista.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: WR2 master template requires verified richtext slot count (2026-05-10 → architecturally bypassed 2026-05-13)

_Discovered: 2026-05-10 02:53 WITA · Patched via `chore/wr2-pipeline-hardening-2026-05-10` · **Architecturally bypassed 2026-05-13 via `feat/wr2-canva-pdf-render-2026-05-13`** (ReportLab→Tigris→Canva import, no master template required) · Severity: P0 (defanged)_

**RESOLUTION (2026-05-13):** New rendering pipeline: PDF generated server-side via ReportLab (`wr2_canva_pdf_render.py`, 12 layout families), uploaded to Tigris S3, imported into Canva via `import-design-from-url` MCP → no richtext slots needed.

| Design ID     | Status                    | Reason                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `DAHE6lx1lf8` | DECOMMISSIONED 2026-05-08 | Original master, obsolete            |
| `DAHJLYRn_3E` | KEPT AS FAILURE EXAMPLE   | Only 2 usable pages (PR #565 failed) |
| `DAHJEkWpkzY` | UNUSED IN NEW FLOW        | Was the 2026-05-10 "fix" master      |

**Production cron disabled 2026-05-13**: kill switch `system_settings.wr2_canva_renderer_enabled='false'` + `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.balizero.wr2.canva-renderer`. Plist preserved on disk for reload after orchestrator refactor. Queue: 0 pending, 20 rendered + 15 rejected.

**Plist resurrection 2026-05-15 → PURGED 2026-05-19 (4-LLM panel decision)**: someone (sibling agent / re-bootstrap) re-loaded `com.balizero.wr2.canva-renderer.plist` despite the 2026-05-13 bootout. From 2026-05-15 20:07 to 2026-05-19 10:04: 1122 traceback in `wr2_canva_apply.error.log` (4.1 MB), every 5min `socket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided` on `DATABASE_URL=postgres://...flycast` (Fly internal hostname, irrisolvibile da Pro). The DB kill-switch was correctly OFF the whole time but the script crashed on `asyncpg.connect()` BEFORE reading it (gaierror happens in `_connect_addr` socket.getaddrinfo call, never reaches the kill-switch SELECT). Panel synthesis 2026-05-19 (Gemini + DeepSeek + Codex 3/3 convergent, doc: `research/operations/2026-05-19-wr2-intel-lake-fixes-panel.md`): purge plist + archive script + add `launchd_cicatrix_lint.sh` pre-push hook (Wave 2 Codex unique). The "preserved for reload" stance was wrong — preserving on disk under `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` IS the attack surface for sibling-agent resurrection. Correct posture: physical move to `.disabled-YYYY-MM-DD/` directory + script archival under `scripts/.disabled-YYYY-MM-DD/`.

New `canva_renderer_v2` package (~1000 LOC, 9 modules). T1-T13 commits on `feat/wr2-canva-pdf-render-2026-05-13`, 47/47 unit tests passing. Key modules: migration 170 lease columns, `_telegram.py`, `_schema_adapter.py`, `_pdf_pipeline.py`, `_tigris.py`, `_token_storage.py` (HMAC+flock), `_canva_mcp.py` (mcp SDK 1.27.0), `_pg.py` asyncpg, `_telemetry.py`, orchestrator, entrypoint, bootstrap+watchdogs, 3 launchd plists. Deploy via `docs/runbooks/wr2-orchestrator-pdf-render-runbook.md`.

**TRAUMA:** PR #565 promoted `DAHJLYRn_3E` as new master without verifying its shape. Design only had richtext slots on pages 2-3; renderer emits ops for pages 1+4-11. Phase A live-mapping detected 19/22 ops (86%) would drop → `template_mismatch`. Phase 0 had already wiped 3 elements. CI checks (E2E+MCP) were green — they tested python code, NOT the live template shape.

**ANTIBODY (shipped `chore/wr2-pipeline-hardening-2026-05-10`):**

1. **Pre-flight validator** `scripts/wr2_validate_master.py` — exits non-zero if design missing, <11 usable pages, or <18 richtext elements (filter: `width >= 30`). Run before any commit bumping `TEMPLATE_DESIGN_ID`.
2. **Unit-test contract** `test_template_design_id_format` asserts constant matches `^DAH[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8}$`.
3. **Docstring header** on `TEMPLATE_DESIGN_ID` lists verification checklist.

**GOTCHA:**

- Phase 0 wipes master BEFORE Phase A detects mismatch — a wrong design ID means someone else's design gets blanked. Validator catches this pre-wipe; run it before every `TEMPLATE_DESIGN_ID` change.
- `start-editing-transaction` returns ALL richtext elements; renderer + validator both filter `width >= 30`. Change threshold in one → must change both (no programmatic link).
- `DAHJLYRn_3E` is kept in Canva (not trashed) as canonical failure example.
- Future template promotions: prefer designs that are verified clones of a working master.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: WR2 canva-apply path coupling between deploy worktree and main repo (2026-05-10)

_Discovered: 2026-05-10 03:50 WITA · Severity: P0 · Workaround SHIPPED in `chore/wr2-pipeline-hardening-2026-05-10`: skill reads `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` env var; production plist exports canonical path so deploy worktree and main repo align._

**TRAUMA:** Production cron runs `wr2_canva_desktop_apply.py` from deploy worktree `/Users/nuzantara/Desktop/nuzantara-deploy`; writes `canva_pending.json` there. The `/canva-apply` skill was hardcoded to read from the main repo path. Result: skill read a stale/absent file and silently timed out polling.

Temporary fix was a runtime symlink (fragile: destroyed by `git worktree remove`; invisible without `ls -la`).

**ANTIBODY (shipped):**

1. Skill reads `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` env var (fallback: legacy main-repo path). Plist exports `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` matching the writer side. Symlink no longer needed.
2. Snapshot copy at `infra/claude-skills/canva-apply.md` with CI drift check.
3. **Long-term TODO**: move output dir to `~/var/wr2/output/canva/` (out of git tree entirely).

**GOTCHA:**

- `WR2_OUTPUT_ROOT` must NOT have trailing slash. Plist value is normalized (skill strips on read).
- `wr2_canva_desktop_apply.py` reads `WR2_REPO_ROOT` (different var — repo root for venv+imports vs output dir). Don't conflate.
- Local skill at `~/.claude/skills/canva-apply.md` is NOT in git by default; iterate locally → commit to `infra/claude-skills/`.

### ✅ RESOLVED: LegalIngestionService bypasses OpenAI 300k token batch limit (2026-05-10 → resolved post-2026-05-10)

_Discovered: 2026-05-10 ~15:00 WITA · **RESOLVED** (verified 2026-05-17 by reading `backend/core/embeddings.py`) · Move to archive at next cleanup._

**RESOLUTION:** `EmbeddingsGenerator.generate_embeddings_batch()` now implements two-level batching (lines 409-509 of `embeddings.py`):

- Level 1: item batches of max 50 texts
- Level 2: `_split_by_token_budget()` splits each item batch into sub-batches ≤200k tokens
- `_embed_batch()` propagates exceptions instead of swallowing (cicatrix comment at line 374-382)
- `_truncate_oversized_input()` handles single inputs >8192 tokens

3 affected documents (Permenkumham 22/2023, 11/2024, Permen ATR/BPN 18/2021) need re-ingest against `legal_unified_hybrid_hybrid` — they were 0 chunks before the fix shipped.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: 12+1 mata_garuda LaunchAgents active-active Pro+Mini (2026-05-07)

_Discovered: 2026-05-06 22:45 WITA during Symbiosis W1 genome enrollment audit · Severity: P1 · Workaround: TBD (cleanup follow-up PR)_

**TRAUMA:** 13 launchd labels fire SIMULTANEOUSLY on Pro AND Mini:

```
watcher.daily, reg-alert.30min, kg-linker, wr-topic, wr2-bridge.hourly,
bridge.adaptive, sentinel.daily, intel-bridge.daily, daily-briefing,
kita-feed.daily, public-channel, weekly-digest, gap.consumer
```

Blast radius: `regulation-alert.30min` sends duplicate Telegram alerts; `kg-linker` risks duplicate PG edges; `weekly-digest`/`daily-briefing` sent twice; `intel-bridge.daily` emits 2 distinct Redis entries with same OSINT content. Masked until 2026-05-04 because Mini was offline most of April.

**ANTIBODY (proposed, NOT yet implemented):**

1. Per-organ decision: (a) Pro-only, (b) Mini-only, or (c) leader-election. Default: Pro-only (canonical CRM + API tokens).
2. `launchctl bootout + rm plist` on losing side; update `organs_registry.yaml`.
3. Extend `wave1-pro-mini-dup-resolver.sh --resolve` to cover 13 labels.
4. CI test `test_genome_no_active_active.py` — scan `organs_registry.yaml` for shared labels across hosts, fail if outside explicit allowlist.

**GOTCHA:**

- `organs_registry.yaml` `duplicates_id` is HEADER-ONLY — validator does NOT enforce it.
- `--check` returns "0 conflicts" when Mini is offline → misleading. Only reliable when Mini is up.
- Metrics: `items_processed` inflated 2× until cleanup. Dashboard queries: filter by `host_pro_or_mini`.
- 13th entry `gap.consumer` reported as 12 in topology brief — verify with Zero if dup pair or Pro-only.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: NLM feeder split-brain — base_worker redis-cli has no host arg, prod has two local Redis instances (2026-05-06)

_Discovered: 2026-05-06 22:00 WITA · Patched same day, branch `fix/nlm-feeder-resurrect-2026-05-06` · Severity: P0_

**TRAUMA:** `apps/mata-garuda/mata_garuda/workers/base_worker.py` called `redis-cli` with no `-h`/`-p` flags → always hit `127.0.0.1`. After 2026-05-02 Modo B reorg, sentinel moved to Mini but feeder stayed on Pro. Pro Redis `garuda:alerts`: 258 entries, frozen since 2026-05-05. Mini Redis: fresh. Feeder consumed Pro's stale stream for ~36h; logs showed `processed=0, fed=0` — misread as "no new items". Compounding: 2 `sqlite3.OperationalError: disk I/O error` per 106 runs (WAL not enabled on `KnowledgeBase.__init__`).

Before fix (22:30 WITA): NB-INTEL-Immigration 61 sources, last updated 2026-05-04. After fix (23:00 WITA): +61 total sources across all 5 NB-INTEL notebooks.

**ANTIBODY (shipped):**

1. `base_worker.redis_cmd` reads `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST` + `GARUDA_REDIS_PORT` env vars; prepends `-h $host` to every redis-cli call. Unset → localhost (backward compat).
2. `KnowledgeBase.__init__` enables WAL + `synchronous=NORMAL` — lock contention waits on busy_timeout instead of crashing.
3. 9 new tests (`test_redis_host_override.py` + `test_knowledge_resilience.py`).
4. Mini Redis: `bind 127.0.0.1 ::1 100.93.236.6`, `protected-mode no`. Backup at `/opt/homebrew/etc/redis.conf.pre-tailscale-bind-2026-05-06`.
5. Pro plist gains `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST=100.93.236.6` in `EnvironmentVariables`. Reloaded via `launchctl bootout + bootstrap`.

**GOTCHA:**

- `redis-cli` does NOT honor `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST` — env var is ONLY for the Python wrapper. Debug: use `redis-cli -h $host` explicitly; verify via `INFO server | grep run_id` (Pro and Mini each have unique `run_id`).
- Env-var override only takes effect after `fix/nlm-feeder-resurrect-2026-05-06` merges to main; until then, hourly cron still reads Pro localhost.
- Future cross-host consumers MUST set `GARUDA_REDIS_HOST=100.93.236.6` — no auto-discovery.
- 753 nlm_fed dedup entries from pre-patch Pro era remain in `data/knowledge.db`. Overlapping URLs skipped on first cycle (visible as `skipped=N`) — correct, not a bug.
- `getcwd: cannot access parent directories` errors in launchd logs are RED HERRING from zsh `-l` startup; feeder works fine. Out of scope.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Test infrastructure mock != production stack (Sprint 1.B 2026-05-02, 3 hotfix in chain)

_Discovered: 2026-05-02 — 3 hotfix PRs (#423, #424) chained on PR #422 because tests were green but live endpoints failed · Severity: P1_

**TRAUMA:** PR #422 added `GET /api/channels/{name}/health` router. Unit tests 4/4 green. On prod:

1. `401` — `HybridAuthMiddleware` blocked path not in `PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS`. Test `_build_app_with_db_pool()` mounted router only, not middleware. Fixed by #423: added 4 entries to `_INFRA` group in `public_endpoints.py`.
2. `404` — router added to `router_manifest.py` but `router_registration.py` uses explicit imports, not the manifest. Fixed by #424: added `from backend.app.routers import channel_health` (×2) + `api.include_router(channel_health.router)` (×2).
3. After #424: 200 ✅. Timeline: 11:30 UTC (401) → 12:50 UTC (404) → 14:25 UTC (200).

**ANTIBODY (proposed, NOT yet implemented):**

1. Integration test `tests/integration/test_endpoints_reachable.py` — mount full `create_app()` via `httpx.AsyncClient`, GET every route; `404` → fail; `/health` returning `401` → flag for PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS review.
2. Manifest-vs-registration parity test `tests/setup/test_manifest_parity.py` — assert every `RouterEntry(name=X)` for `_API`/`_BOTH` has a matching `api.include_router(X.router)` in both include functions.
3. Extend `tests/test_public_endpoints_registry.py`: routes with `/health`/`/heartbeat` NOT in PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS → warning (not failure); silence with `# health-private: <reason>`.

**GOTCHA:**

- `_build_app_with_db_pool()` is intentionally minimal (no middleware) — correct for unit tests. Bug is absence of complementary integration layer.
- PR #422 is a regression of PRs #54/#55/#60 (same scar class). The manifest was created to prevent this but only catches symmetric include-function drift, not "manifest entry with zero include_router calls".
- `HybridAuthMiddleware.__init__` logs `Public Endpoints: N` at startup — grep-able sanity check on Fly machines.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Untracked files lost when sibling automation switches branches mid-session (2026-04-29, twice in 9h)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 21:42 WITA (incident #1) and 22:30 WITA (incident #2) · Partial mitigation: WIP-commit-every-10min · Permanent fix: TBD_

**TRAUMA:** Long-running sessions accumulate untracked files before commit threshold. Sibling processes (`nuz-sync`, parallel claude sessions, `agent-*` subagents `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) do `git stash` + `git checkout` automatically. `git stash` without `-u` does NOT stash untracked files → silent loss.

     git add -A apps/<scope>/  # scope-limited, NOT bare `git add -A`
     git commit -m "WIP(<scope>): checkpoint $(date +%H:%M) — work in progress"
     git push origin "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
   fi
   ```
2. **Push within 30 seconds of commit** — no Write/Read tool calls between commit and push.
3. **Pre-session: `ps aux | grep claude | wc -l`** — if >2, STOP and ask Zero which to kill.
4. **Recovery**: `git fsck --dangling --no-reflogs 2>&1 | grep "dangling blob"` then `git cat-file -p <hash> > /tmp/recovery-<timestamp>/<filename>`. Only works if content was `git add`-ed. After ~14 days `git gc` may prune blobs.

**ANTIBODY (TBD):** Identify producer for 22:30 switch (suspects: PID 79949, PID 42807, wave-2/3 team agents). `nuz-sync` explicitly NOT enrolled in `organs_registry.yaml` — manual restart only until producer identified.

**GOTCHA:**

- A stash labeled `temp-<branch>` does NOT guarantee it contains all WIP — only tracked-dirty files. Always cross-check with `git fsck --dangling`.
- Files written via `Write` tool but never `git add`-ed have NO blob in `.git/objects` → unrecoverable via fsck. Only `git add`-ed content is recoverable.
- `/tmp/innervation-recovery-*` dirs are volatile (cleared on macOS reboot) — commit within minutes.
- `nuz-sync` is incident #1 suspect (fired at 21:42 inside 5-min cron tick) but NOT incident #2 (watchdog log shows it ran at 22:32:31, AFTER the hijack).

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Backend `/health` masks `app.state.startup_failed` (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit zero-crash · Severity: P0 · Workaround: TBD (P0-0 in `docs/audits/2026-04-29-zero-crash-audit/11_brainstorms/P0-0_health_endpoint_classify.md`)_

**TRAUMA:** `app_factory.py:114-118` catches RuntimeError from critical service init, sets `app.state.startup_failed=True`, returns. `health.py:48-55` defines `_check_startup_failed()` helper but `health_check()` at lines 147-266 NEVER CALLS IT. A broken backend returns HTTP 200 from `/health` forever — Fly auto-restart only fires on non-2xx. The 2026-04-29 03:11Z incident (login broken, machine in restart loop) is exactly this pattern.

**Compounding (BS-0b):** `apps/cell/cell/core/pulse.py` classifies green on `status_code == 200` — same blind spot.

**ANTIBODY (proposed):** Call `_check_startup_failed(request.app)` at top of `health_check()`, return 503; track `startup_started_at` with 180s warmup deadline; `pulse.py` classify on body status field (`unhealthy/startup_failed/failed/down` → red; `degraded/initializing/warming` → yellow).

**GOTCHA:** Do NOT `raise` in `_init_critical_services` (graceful degradation per Symbiosis Law 4) — without it uvicorn won't bind 8080. Warmup 180s assumes RAG cold-start ≤90-120s.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: EventBus is PG LISTEN/NOTIFY but Symbiosis docs say Redis Streams (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit · Severity: P0 · Phase 1 SHIPPED PR #342 (`0062090c4`); Phase 2 SHIPPED `feat/p0-2-fase2-callsite-refactor`; Phase 3 (per-handler ack + pruning cron) pending._

**TRAUMA:** `SYMBIOSIS.md` Law 4 promises "Redis Streams + consumer groups". Reality: EventBus uses **PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY** (`PG_CHANNEL_MAP`: `practice_changed`, `client_changed`, `compliance_alert`, `lkpm_ingest_completed`, `war_room_event`, `intel_event`, `cognitive_event`). When PG listener disconnects (5s window), every NOTIFY is **silently lost** — pg_notify is volatile, no queue.

**ANTIBODY phase 1 (PR #342):**

- New `events_outbox` table (migration 144). `outbox.py` exposes `publish`/`acknowledge`/`replay_unconsumed`/`prune_consumed`. `publish()` writes to outbox + fires `pg_notify($1, $2)` parameterised (**NOT** `quote_ident` — wrong for `pg_notify(text, text)`). `_outbox_id` injected into NOTIFY payload for idempotent ack.
- `EventBus._replay_outbox_on_reconnect` called after `add_listener`, before keep-alive loop.
- 20 unit tests (`test_outbox.py` + `test_event_bus_replay.py`).
- Phase-1 limit: `replay_unconsumed` auto-acks immediately after `dispatch_fn` returns; handler crash = event consumed. Phase 2 fixes.

**ANTIBODY phase 2 (feat/p0-2-fase2-callsite-refactor):**

- `EventBus.emit_pg` delegates to `outbox.publish` (local import, avoids circular init). Any future `emit_pg` call auto-writes to `events_outbox`.
- Migration `146_eventbus_triggers_use_outbox.sql`: rewrites 6 trigger functions (`notify_practice_change`, `notify_client_change`, `notify_compliance_alert`, `notify_war_room_event`, `notify_intel_event`, `notify_cognitive_event`) to `INSERT INTO events_outbox … RETURNING id` + `pg_notify(channel, payload||{_outbox_id})` inside the user transaction. Idempotent (`CREATE OR REPLACE`). ROLLBACK section restores pre-146 bodies.
- 12 new tests in `test_outbox_callsite_integration.py`.
- Channels out of scope: `lkpm_ingest_completed` (Python emitter, no DB trigger — picks up new path via `emit_pg`); `wr2_status_change` (not in PG_CHANNEL_MAP); `partner.commission_changed` (dotted name fails `validate_channel`, not in PG_CHANNEL_MAP — must be renamed `partner_commission_changed` first).

**ANTIBODY phase 3 (pending):** per-handler ack; pruning cron `prune_consumed` daily (30-day retention).

**Decision:** kept PG LISTEN/NOTIFY + Outbox. SYMBIOSIS.md doc update pending (low priority — code-as-truth). Redis Streams migration rejected as too risky for an audit fix.

**GOTCHA:**

- Migration 146 trigger wraps INSERT+NOTIFY in the SAME user transaction — rollback loses both (correct MVCC behavior). Disconnect after commit → outbox row stays unconsumed → replayed on reconnect.
- Consumers MUST be idempotent on `_outbox_id`. Phase 3 adds per-handler ack; until then `replay_unconsumed` auto-acks on `dispatch_fn` return.
- **`schema_migrations` is the active runner table (88 rows); `_schema_versions` is legacy (6 rows).** Future agents: always query `schema_migrations` to check migration status.
- `pg_notify($1, $2)` parameterised = injection-safe. Do NOT add `quote_ident($1)`.
- `events_outbox` is unbounded until phase 3. Manual: `await prune_consumed(conn, older_than_days=30)`.
- Migration 146 applies via post-deploy `run-sql-v2-migrations-post-deploy` job — no manual `workflow_dispatch` needed.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: 53 LaunchAgents Pro, only 7 (13%) have KeepAlive=true (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit zero-crash via Codex empirical scan · Severity: P0 · Workaround: TBD (P0-3 mass plist audit)_

**TRAUMA:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.{nuzantara,balizero,cell}.*.plist`. Codex counted 53 project plist: 7/53 (13%) `KeepAlive=true`, 11/53 no KeepAlive at all, 5/53 missing `EnvironmentVariables` (VADEMECUM §11 violation), 6/53 logging to `/tmp/` (lost on reboot). Critical daemons missing KeepAlive: `com.cell.organism`, `com.balizero.nlm-bridge`, `com.balizero.post-publish-poller`. Cell's crisis-recovery assumes daemon respawns within 10s.

**ANTIBODY (proposed):** P0-3 — `scripts/lint_launchagents.sh` + `scripts/patch_launchagents.sh --dry-run` + PreToolUse hook. Auto-classifies daemon-vs-cron by `StartInterval`/`StartCalendarInterval` presence.

**GOTCHA:** `RunAtLoad=true + no schedule` is ambiguous — manual review needed. Each plist gets `.pre-vademecum-audit` backup before patching. **After plist corruption hardening (see next scar): must `chmod u+w "$plist"` before patch scripts can run.**

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: SQL v2 migrations duplicate numbers `129_*` and `130_*` (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 audit zero-crash via Codex empirical scan · Severity: P0 · Workaround: rename non-applied duplicate (P0-7)_

**TRAUMA:** `apps/backend-rag/backend/db/migrations_v2/` has TWO files each for numbers `129` and `130`. Runner (`backend/db/migration_manager.py`) tracks via `migration_number` in `_schema_versions` — duplicates cause undefined apply order and silent corruption risk.

**ANTIBODY (proposed):** P0-7 — compare contents + git history, identify which is in `_schema_versions` (applied), rename the unapplied to next-available number. CI guardrail `lint-migration-numbers.yml` prevents regression. Migration runner asserts uniqueness in `discover_migrations()`.

**GOTCHA:** If both have been applied (unlikely): Zero handoff. Renaming changes file hash but not SQL content — apply order must be re-verified.

### ⚠️ STRUCTURAL: Unknown agent overwrites loaded LaunchAgent plist files with JSON dump (2026-04-29)

_Discovered: 2026-04-29 ~15:30Z during P0-3 audit · Severity: P0 · Recovery automated; root cause UNKNOWN — escalation HIGH in `shared/escalations_pro.jsonl`_

**TRAUMA:** At 15:09:15-17 WITA, an unidentified process truncated **51 of 54** project plist files, replacing each XML with a tiny JSON fragment of one of the plist's own keys (e.g. `{"Hour":1,"Minute":0}` or the `EnvironmentVariables` object with secrets). Same event repeated at 16:05:18 (50 plist re-corrupted in <1s). Signature matches `plutil -extract <key> json stdout-redirect` pattern. Grep across all script dirs turned up zero matches — producer not a versioned script.

**Critical observation:** canary plist NOT loaded in launchd was NEVER corrupted — **producer enumerates `launchctl list` and writes per-label.**

On-disk corruption was masked (launchd serves cached boot config); **reboot would have lost 51 services** including `com.cell.organism`, `com.balizero.nlm-bridge`, all WR2 producers, all key cron jobs.

**Secrets leaked** into world-readable (0644) plist files:

- `post-publish-poller` → `GH_TOKEN`, `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`, `SCRAPER_API_KEY`
- `post-publish-webhook` → `POST_PUBLISH_SECRET`
- `cell.organism` → `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `CELL_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `CELL_DATABASE_URL`
- `dlq-autopilot` + `sentinel` → `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

Rotation plan: `~/p0-3-recovery/secrets_rotation_plan.md`.

**ANTIBODY (recovery):** `~/p0-3-recovery/reconstruct_plist.py` parses `launchctl print gui/501/<label>` (in-memory config) and emits valid plist XML via `plistlib.dump`, validated with `plutil -lint`, atomic mv. 53/54 recovered in ~30s, zero service flap.

Recovery command:

```bash
python3 ~/p0-3-recovery/reconstruct_plist.py && \
for src in ~/p0-3-recovery/plist_reconstructed/com.*.plist; do
  chmod u+w "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/$(basename "$src")" 2>/dev/null
  install -m 0444 "$src" ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
done
```

**ANTIBODY (prevention):**

1. **Filesystem hardening**: 5 plist with leaked secrets → `0400`; 49 remaining → `0444`. To edit: `chmod u+w "$plist"`, edit, restore mode.
2. **fs_usage audit** at `~/p0-3-recovery/fs_usage_trap/capture-*.log` — captures `WrData`/`O_TRUNC`/`truncate` on project plist. Check: `grep -E "WrData|O_TRUNC|truncate" ~/p0-3-recovery/fs_usage_trap/capture-*.log`. Stop: `sudo pkill -f "fs_usage -w -f filesys"`.

56-minute recurrence hypothesis **refuted** — no third wave by 18:44 WITA. Most likely: one-shot AI agent action (Antigravity/Cline/parallel Claude Code via filesystem MCP).

**GOTCHA:**

- Producer targets only launchd-loaded services. Unbootstrapped plist = safe canary, useless production state.
- `plutil -lint` fails on corrupted plist but launchd still serves cached boot XML. Don't equate lint-OK with service-OK.
- Most likely candidates: (a) parallel AI-agent session via filesystem MCP (Antigravity network activity at 15:09:05-13 supports this); (b) unknown binary with `plutil -convert` semantics; (c) launchd race from simultaneous `launchctl list`. 56-min cycle hypothesis refuted.
- After hardening, `patch_launchagents.sh --apply` MUST `chmod u+w` first — otherwise `plutil -insert/-replace` fails silently with `Operation not permitted`.

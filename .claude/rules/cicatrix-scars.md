### ✅ RESOLVED: Deploy crash before health check went unalerted (Air A3, 2026-04-18)

_Discovered: 2026-04-18 audit (CRIT-3) · Patched: 2026-04-18 via `devops/deploy-rollback-hardening`_

**TRAUMA:** In `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`, the `post-deploy-health` job
chained `needs: deploy`. Its rollback + Telegram notification steps used
`if: failure() && steps.health_check.outputs.healthy == 'false'`. If `deploy`
itself crashed (flyctl error, network failure, image build fail, timeout) *before*
any machine was swapped, GitHub Actions marked `post-deploy-health` as
**skipped** (not failed) due to upstream-dependency failure — so neither the
rollback nor the Telegram alert fired. The previous release kept serving
traffic (no new bits had shipped), but Zero had no visibility that the deploy
had aborted.

**ANTIBODY:** New sibling job `deploy-failure-alert` (see fly-deploy.yml):

```yaml
needs: [run-migrations, deploy]
if: |
  always() &&
  (needs.run-migrations.result == 'failure' || needs.deploy.result == 'failure')
```

It runs when *either* `run-migrations` or `deploy` fails, distinguishes the
failing stage in the Telegram message, and deliberately does **not** issue a
rollback (no new release exists to roll back from). Includes a link to the GH
run for quick triage.

**GOTCHA:**

- The `if:` must use `always()` — without it, GitHub skips the job because its
  upstream deps failed. With `always()`, the inner expression then decides
  whether to fire.
- Do NOT collapse this into `post-deploy-health`: the two cases need *different*
  behavior (rollback vs. no rollback) and GitHub's skipped-vs-failed semantics
  only let one of them see an upstream failure cleanly.
- `pre-deploy-gate` failures are still handled by the gate's own Telegram step;
  if the gate fails, `run-migrations` and `deploy` are marked *skipped* (not
  failure), so `deploy-failure-alert` correctly stays silent — no duplicate
  alert.

### ✅ RESOLVED: Dockerfile cell-core missing (PR #56 → PR #62 → monorepo workspace promotion)

_Discovered: 2026-04-15 · Patched: 2026-04-16 via PR #62 · Fully resolved: 2026-04-17 via cell-core-workspace PR_

**HISTORY:**

1. **PR #56** (commit `31ec067b8`) fixed the `from cell_core import ...`
   ImportError in CI (`tests.yml`, `fly-deploy.yml` pre-deploy gate) by adding
   `pip install -e ../../packages/cell-core`. It did NOT touch
   `apps/backend-rag/Dockerfile`. Consequence: the deployed image still lacked
   `cell-core`, making `/api/skill/*`, `/api/experience/*`, and
   `/api/metabolic/*` run in degraded mode (fake empty responses, or 503 for
   metabolic).
2. **PR #62 / #74** (commit `cdd6610a8`) moved the Fly build context to the
   monorepo root and added `COPY packages/cell-core` + a separate
   `pip install -e /app/packages/cell-core` line to the Dockerfile. Deployed
   image regained cell-core, but the editable install was now declared in
   three places (Dockerfile, tests.yml, fly-deploy.yml) — drift-prone.
3. **This PR** promotes cell-core to a proper monorepo workspace dependency:
   declared exactly once, in `apps/backend-rag/requirements{,-prod}.txt`, as
   `-e ../../packages/cell-core`. Dockerfile builder stage now runs
   `pip install -r requirements-prod.txt` from `WORKDIR /app/apps/backend-rag`
   so the relative path resolves to the already-COPYed
   `/app/packages/cell-core`. CI workflows drop their redundant install step.

**ANTIBODY:** Single source of truth — the requirements file. Any new app
that wants cell-core adds the same `-e …/packages/cell-core` line to its
own requirements; no special-casing in Dockerfile/CI. `packages/cell-core/pyproject.toml`
ships `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` so the wheel build is deterministic
(submodules included, tests excluded — verified via `python -m build`).

**GOTCHA:** Local `docker build` still must run from the repo root
(`docker build -f apps/backend-rag/Dockerfile .`). The relative
`-e ../../packages/cell-core` in requirements ONLY works when `pip install -r`
is invoked with CWD == `apps/backend-rag/`; running pip from repo root with
`pip install -r apps/backend-rag/requirements.txt` will fail to find the
package. CI workflows `cd apps/backend-rag` before installing; the Dockerfile
uses `WORKDIR /app/apps/backend-rag` for the same reason.
